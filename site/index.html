      <p class="mb-6">Hello everyone,</p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        For those who don’t know me yet, I’m Jessica. I’ve been living in the <span class="font-semibold">South of France</span>
        for a little over two years now with my family. We moved from London in the summer of 2023 to live a slower life in a village
        between Nimes and Montpellier.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        During our time here, I’ve fallen completely in love with the beautiful landscapes, local food markets and brocantes and delicious food —
        and I wanted to find a way to share all of that magic with you.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        That’s how <span class="font-semibold">Belle Rêve Retreats</span> came to life — a dream to invite you into my world here in the Camargue.
        I want to take you to my favourite hidden corners, the sun-soaked villages, and the lively market stalls overflowing with colours and flavours.
        Most of all, I want to create a space for women to come together — to slow down, connect, share stories, enjoy beautiful meals, and make new friends
        in a truly inspiring setting. This is your chance to take part in a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6 font-semibold text-center">
        ✨ What to Expect ✨
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        You’ll be staying in a charming <span class="font-semibold">French maison de ville</span> with a swimming pool and a private chef taking care of us throughout the retreat.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Here are just a few of the highlights I have planned for you:<br>
        🥖 A visit to one of Provence’s most beloved Saturday markets<br>
        🍷 A traditional French cooking class<br>
        🎨 A hands-on ceramics workshop<br>
        🧘‍♀️ Yoga and vinyasa sessions<br>
        🐎 A Camargue safari and horse riding adventure<br>
        ☀️  Apéro on the beach
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
